## Building Mini Banking System

In this project, you will build a simple mini banking system using only the concepts you have learned so far. You will design functions to create accounts, manage balances, perform transactions, and display account summaries.

Focus on writing clean, well-structured code using functions, lists, dictionaries, loops, and exception handling. Do not use external libraries.

## Project Requirements

---

### Part 1: Simulate a Database

Create a global list called:

`accounts`

This list will store all bank accounts.

Each account should be stored as a dictionary containing: name, balance, transactions

The transactions field must be a list. Each transaction should be stored as a dictionary containing: type and amount

---

### Part 2: Add Expense Function

Create a function:

`create_account(name, initial_balance)`

This function must:

- Validate that the initial balance is not negative
- Raise a ValueError if the balance is invalid
- Prevent duplicate account names
- Create a dictionary for the account
- Append it to the accounts list
- Return the created account

---

### Part 3: Deposit Function

Create a function:

`deposit(name, amount)`

This function must:

- Validate that the amount is greater than 0
- Raise a ValueError if the amount is invalid
- Find the correct account
- Increase the balance
- Add a transaction record with type "Deposit"
- Return the updated balance

---

### Part 4: Withdraw Function

Create a function:

`withdraw(name, amount)`

This function must:

- Validate that the amount is greater than 0
- Raise a ValueError if the amount is invalid
- Find the correct account
- Ensure sufficient balance before withdrawing
- Raise a ValueError if funds are insufficient
- Decrease the balance
- Add a transaction record with type "Withdrawal"
- Return the updated balance

---

### Part 5: Show Account Summary

Create a function:

`show_account(name)`

This function must:

- Display the account name
- Display the current balance
- Display all transactions clearly

---

### Part 6: Testing Section

Add a testing section at the bottom of your script that:

- Creates at least one account
- Performs multiple deposits
- Performs multiple withdrawals
- Attempts an overdraft
- Attempts creating a duplicate account
- Displays the account summary

---

## Final Requirements

Your solution must:

- Be clean and well structured
- Use readable variable names
- Include comments where necessary to explain your logic
- Make sure to follow best practices writing functions including descriptions
- Follow proper indentation and formatting
- Avoid unnecessary or duplicated code

This project is designed to test your understanding of functions, validation logic, exception handling, and structured thinking. If you can build this system confidently and cleanly on your own, you are thinking like a real Python developer.
