## Building an Expense Tracking System

In this project, you will build a simple expense tracking system using only the concepts you have learned so far. You will design functions to add, store, analyze, and summarize expenses.

Before you start, try to solve this project completely on your own. Do not immediately check the solution. Only review the solution if you truly struggle after making a serious attempt. Avoid using AI tools for this task. The goal is to strengthen your thinking and problem-solving skills.

## Project Requirements

---

### Part 1: Simulate a Database

Create a global list called:

`expenses`

This list will store all expense entries.

Each expense should be stored as a dictionary containing: amount, category, description

---

### Part 2: Add Expense Function

Create a function:

`add_expense(amount, category, description)`

This function must:

- Validate that amount is greater than 0
- Raise a ValueError if the amount is invalid
- Create a dictionary for the expense
- Append it to the expenses list
- Return the created expense

---

### Part 3: Calculate Total Expenses

Create a function:

`calculate_total_expenses()`

This function must:

- Loop through all expenses
- Calculate the total amount
- Return the total

---

### Part 4: Calculate Total by Category

Create a function:

`calculate_total_by_category(category)`

This function must:

- Loop through expenses
- Calculate the total only for the given category
- Return the total

---

### Part 5: Show All Expenses

Create a function:

`show_expenses()`

This function must display all stored expenses clearly

---

### Part 6: Testing Section

Add a testing section at the bottom of your script that:

- Adds multiple expenses
- Includes at least one invalid expense
- Prints total expenses
- Prints total for a specific category
- Displays all stored expenses

---

## Final Requirements

Your solution must:

- Be clean and well structured
- Use readable variable names
- Include comments where necessary to explain your logic
- Make sure to follow best practices writing functions including descriptions
- Follow proper indentation and formatting
- Avoid unnecessary or duplicated code

This project is designed to test your understanding of functions, validation logic, exception handling, and structured thinking. If you can build this system confidently and cleanly on your own, you are thinking like a real Python developer.
