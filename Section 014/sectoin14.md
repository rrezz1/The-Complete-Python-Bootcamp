# Project Requirements

In this project, you will build a small user registration system using only the concepts you have learned so far. You must create all validation logic yourself and properly structure the system using functions, lists, dictionaries, loops, and exception handling.

Before you start, try to solve this project completely on your own. Do not immediately check the solution. Only review the solution if you truly struggle after making a serious attempt. Avoid using AI tools for this task. The goal is to strengthen your thinking and problem-solving skills.

## Part 1: Simulate a Database

Create two global lists:

- `registered_users` list will store successfully registered users.
- `failed_registrations` list will store information about failed registration attempts.

---

## Part 2: Create Validation Functions

You must create the following three functions:

### `validate_name(name)`

- The name must contain at least 3 characters.
- Return True if the name is valid, otherwise return False.

### `validate_email(email)`

- The email must contain both "@" and ".".
- Return True if the email format is valid, otherwise return False.

### `validate_password(password)`

The password must meet all of the following conditions:

- At least 8 characters long
- Contains at least one uppercase letter
- Contains at least one digit

Return True if the password is valid, otherwise return False.

---

## Part 3: Create a Main Validation Function

Create an orchestrator function called `validate_user_data(name, email, password)`

This function must:

- Call the three validation functions you created
- Raise a `ValueError` with a clear and descriptive message if any validation fails
- Return True if all validations pass successfully

---

## Part 4: Create the Registration Function

Create a function called `create_user_account(name, email, password)`

This function must:

- Call `validate_user_data()` to validate the inputs.
- Check whether the email already exists in the `registered_users` list.
- If a duplicate email is found, raise a `ValueError`.

If validation passes and the email is not duplicated:

- Create a dictionary containing name, email, password, and a status set to `"active"`.
- Append the dictionary to `registered_users`.
- Return the created user dictionary.

If any error occurs during validation or duplicate checking:

- Catch the `ValueError`.
- Store a dictionary inside `failed_registrations` containing the email and the error message.
- Return `None`.

---

## Part 5: Testing Your Implementation

After completing your solution, add a simple testing section at the bottom of your script.

Test the following cases:

- A valid registration
- A duplicate email
- An invalid name
- An invalid email
- A weak password

For each case:

- Call `create_user_account()`
- Print the result
- Print the final contents of `registered_users`
- Print the final contents of `failed_registrations`

The goal is to clearly demonstrate how your system behaves in both successful and failed scenarios.

---

## Final Requirements

Your solution must:

- Be clean and well structured
- Use readable variable names
- Include comments where necessary to explain your logic
- Make sure to follow best practices writing functions including descriptions
- Follow proper indentation and formatting
- Avoid unnecessary or duplicated code

This project is designed to test your understanding of functions, validation logic, exception handling, and structured thinking. If you can build this system confidently and cleanly on your own, you are thinking like a real Python developer.
